## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new):

1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. Import your project to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js app and configure the build settings
4. Your app will be deployed and you'll get a URL
